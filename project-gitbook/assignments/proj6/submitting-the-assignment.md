# Submitting the Assignment

### Files

You should make sure that all code you modify belongs to the .js files inside the `query/` directory.

### Gradescope

Once all of your files are prepared in your repo you can submit to Gradescope through GitHub the same way you did for [Project 0](../proj0/submitting.md#pushing-changes-to-github-classroom).

If you want to submit via upload, you can zip up your `query/` directory and upload that to Gradescope instead.

### Grading

* This project will be worth 6% of your overall grade in the class. 100% of your grade will come from the public tests provided to you.
