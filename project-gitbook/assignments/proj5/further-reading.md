# Further Reading

If you enjoyed the material in this project and the previous project \(Locking\), we recommend reading through the ARIES paper \([link here](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/cs345/rl/aries.pdf)\)!

Nothing in the ARIES paper is in-scope for the class \(and where what we teach in class conflicts with the paper, material from this class takes precedence\), but the paper \(albeit long\) is well-written and talks more about the context behind design decisions for both multigranularity locking and ARIES, as well as more details that come up in implementations. You should have enough background at this point in the course to read and understand it, so we recommend reading through it at your own pace if this portion of the course caught your interest.
