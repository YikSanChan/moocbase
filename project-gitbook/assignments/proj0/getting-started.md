# Getting Started

## Logistics

This assignment is due **Thursday, 9/3/2020 at 11:59PM PDT (GMT-7)**. It is worth 0% of your overall grade, but failure to complete it may result in being **administratively dropped from the class**.

## Prerequisites

No lectures are required to work through this assignment.

## `git` and GitHub

[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a _version control_ system, that helps developers like you track different versions of your code, synchronize them across different machines, and collaborate with others. If you don't already have git on your machine you can follow the instructions [here ](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)to install it.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a site which supports this system, hosting it as a service. In order to get a copies of the skeleton code to work on during the semester you'll need to create an account.

We will be using git and GitHub to pass out assignments in this course. If you don't know much about git, that isn't a problem: you will _need_ to use it only in very simple ways that we will show you in order to keep up with class assignments.

If you'd like to use git for managing your own code versioning, there are many guides to using git online -- [this](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started) is a good one.

### Fetching the released code

For each project, we will provide a GitHub Classroom link. Follow the link to create a GitHub repository with the starter code for the project you are working on. Use `git clone` to get a local copy of the newly created repository. For example, if your GitHub username is `oski` after being assigned your repo through GitHub Classroom you would run:

`git clone https://github.com/berkeley-cs186-student/fa20-proj0-oski`

The GitHub Classroom link for this project is provided in the project release post on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kducz9b1i3h78i?cid=24).

## Setting up your local development environment

You are free to use any text editor or IDE to complete the assignments, but **we will build and test your code in a Docker container with Maven**.

We recommend setting up a local development environment by installing Java 8 locally \(the version our Docker container runs\) and using an IDE such as IntelliJ.

[Java 8 downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

If you have a newer version of Java installed that should be fine, we'll do our best to support grading for those versions up to Java 11 \(the most recent version used by 61B\). We won't be able to support any new syntaxes or features introduced in Java 12 or later.

To import the project into IntelliJ, make sure that you import as a Maven project \(select the `pom.xml` file when importing\).

![After hitting Import Project navigate to the pom.xml file and open it.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.png)

If launching IntelliJ takes you to an existing workspace instead of showing you the popup above you can open the project by navigating to `File -> New -> Project From Existing Sources` and then select the `pom.xml` file.

### Running tests in IntelliJ

If you are using IntelliJ and wish to run the tests for a given assignment follow the instructions in the following document: [IntelliJ setup](https://github.com/berkeley-cs186/fa20-moocbase/blob/master/intellij-test-setup.md)

Once you have a copy of the released code, head to the next section "Your Tasks" and begin working on the assignment.
